# Work-Day-Calendar by Ely Leslie

This application is capable of:

1. Receiving your input
2. Memorizing what is being said.
3. Changing color based on the real life present time.
4. Counting each second that passes in real time.
5. Changing information in text boxes based on new input.

Here you can find a visual presentation of my work. Please enjoy! ^_^ ![A list of items on a scheduling calendar, multiple hours of the day have already been spent and are grey. The current hour is red, and hours that have yet to transpire are green.](./assets/images/Screenshot.PNG)

Thank you to <b><u>Bryan Borek</b></u> and <b><u>Trinh Ngyuen</b></u>
